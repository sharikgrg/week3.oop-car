# OOP Vehicles and Cars

learning outcomes:
- create a class
- create instances of classes
- abstraction
- inheritance
when the parameters are brought on to the sub class from the charcater class
- polymorphism
sub class will have it's own parameter. so adding these extra methods and characteristics. 
- (after/later) Encapsulation
